# Nokia-Snake-Game
Developed a classic Nokia Snake game clone, focusing on simple graphics, smooth controls, and efficient game logic using C++ and the Raylib Library.
Features a high score system that displays scores after each game over.
Run using the "main.code-workspace" file
(Game not fully polished, will be in the coming future) :)))
